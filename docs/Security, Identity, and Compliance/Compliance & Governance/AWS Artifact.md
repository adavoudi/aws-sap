# AWS Artifact

## 1. Introduction

In today’s digital landscape, cloud security and regulatory compliance are not just optional add-ons—they are foundational requirements for doing business. AWS Artifact addresses these needs by centralizing access to compliance reports and legal agreements in one user-friendly portal. With AWS Artifact, organizations can effortlessly retrieve independent audit reports and manage agreements that are crucial for meeting regulatory standards, mitigating risk, and building trust with stakeholders. This self-service model not only saves time and resources but also simplifies the complex process of maintaining a secure, compliant cloud environment.  

## 2. Compliance Reports

One of the core functions of AWS Artifact is to provide immediate access to a variety of compliance reports. These reports serve as vital audit artifacts that help organizations verify and document their cloud security posture.

### Types of Compliance Reports

- **SOC Reports:**  
    AWS Artifact offers different types of SOC reports—including SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3—that detail AWS’s internal controls related to financial reporting, security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy. These reports are instrumental for customers who need to assess the operational efficiency of AWS’s security controls.
    
- **ISO Certifications:**  
    With ISO reports such as ISO 27001, ISO 27017, and ISO 27018, AWS Artifact enables organizations to access internationally recognized certifications. These certifications affirm that AWS adheres to stringent information security and privacy standards.
    
- **PCI DSS Compliance:**  
    For businesses that handle payment card data, PCI DSS reports validate that AWS services meet the rigorous standards set by the Payment Card Industry. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of financial transactions in a secure environment.
    
- **GDPR & HIPAA Documentation:**  
    In addition to the technical reports, AWS Artifact also provides documentation that supports compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA. This documentation assists organizations in demonstrating their commitment to protecting personal data and maintaining privacy.

### On-Demand Access

The ability to download these reports on-demand through AWS Artifact removes the need for manual requests or lengthy wait times. This not only accelerates audit preparations but also supports continuous compliance by ensuring that the latest documents are always at your fingertips.  

## 3. Agreements & Policies

Beyond compliance reports, AWS Artifact also serves as a centralized hub for managing the legal agreements that govern your relationship with AWS.

### Key Agreements and Policies

- **Service Terms & NDAs:**  
    AWS provides standard service terms and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) that outline the responsibilities and rights of both AWS and its customers. These documents form the legal foundation for using AWS services.
    
- **Acceptable Use Policies (AUP):**  
    AUPs define the acceptable ways to use AWS services, ensuring that customers adhere to best practices and maintain a secure operating environment.
    
- **Custom Agreements (e.g., HIPAA BAA):**  
    For organizations subject to specific regulatory requirements, such as healthcare providers, AWS Artifact offers custom agreements like the HIPAA Business Associate Addendum (BAA). These tailored agreements help ensure that sensitive health information is managed in accordance with legal standards.

### Managing Agreements

AWS Artifact enables you to review, accept, and track these agreements across multiple AWS accounts, simplifying the management process. By centralizing these policies, organizations can maintain consistency and quickly adapt to any changes in regulatory or contractual requirements.  

## 4. Supported Compliance Frameworks

AWS Artifact is designed to support a wide range of compliance frameworks, ensuring that organizations can align their cloud strategies with both industry-specific and international standards.

### Industry Standards and Regulatory Frameworks

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**  
    AWS Artifact provides documentation that helps organizations demonstrate compliance with GDPR, thereby ensuring the protection of personal data for EU citizens.
    
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act):**  
    For healthcare organizations, the portal offers access to HIPAA-related compliance documents and the necessary agreements (like the HIPAA BAA), reinforcing the security of sensitive health information.
    
- **FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program):**  
    By aligning with FedRAMP, AWS Artifact supports government agencies and contractors in meeting federal security standards.

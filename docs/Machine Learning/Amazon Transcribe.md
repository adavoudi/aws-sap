## 1. Introduction

Amazon Transcribe is a fully managed automatic speech recognition (ASR) service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that converts speech to text using advanced machine learning models. It is designed to handle both real-time streaming and batch transcription of audio, making it an ideal solution for developers who want to embed speech-to-text capabilities in their applications. Amazon Transcribe is used across various industries—from contact centers to media and healthcare—to automate the conversion of audio content into searchable, analyzable text while ensuring high accuracy and scalability.  

## 2. Features and Capabilities

Amazon Transcribe provides a rich set of features and capabilities that enable developers to customize and secure their transcription workflows:

- **Real-time & Batch Transcription:**  
    Process live audio streams as well as pre-recorded files stored in Amazon S3. This dual mode supports a wide range of use cases—from interactive voice applications to large-scale media processing.  
    
- **Automatic Language Identification:**  
    Detects the dominant language in an audio file automatically, enabling transcription without pre-specifying the language. This is especially useful when dealing with multilingual content.  
    
- **Speaker Diarization and Channel Identification:**  
    Distinguish and label individual speakers in multi-speaker audio recordings, making transcripts more intelligible for meetings, call centers, and interviews. Additionally, channel identification allows differentiation when multiple audio channels are present in a single file.  
    
- **Punctuation, Number Normalization, and Timestamps:**  
    Transcripts include automatic punctuation and number formatting along with word-level timestamps, making it easier to navigate and search through the text.  
    
- **Customization with Custom Vocabulary and Language Models:**  
    Enhance transcription accuracy by adding domain-specific terms, product names, or technical jargon through custom vocabularies. For more refined use cases, developers can train custom language models using their own text corpora.  
    
- **User Safety & Privacy:**  
    Built-in features like vocabulary filtering and automatic redaction help remove or mask sensitive and profane content from transcripts, ensuring that the output is appropriate and secure.

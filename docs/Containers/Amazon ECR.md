# Amazon ECR

## 1. Introduction

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container registry service designed to simplify storing, managing, and deploying Docker and Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. It eliminates the need to operate your own container repositories and scales automatically with your workloads. ECR supports both private registries for your internal applications and a public registry (the Amazon ECR Public Gallery) for sharing images globally.

## 2. Repository Types

### 2.1. Private Repositories

Every AWS account automatically includes a private container registry. Private repositories are used to store Docker or OCI images for internal use. By default, only your AWS account has access.

Access to these repositories is managed using both AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and resource-based repository policies. This allows you to tightly control who can push, pull, or manage the images, ensuring that only authorized users or services have access.

### 2.2. Public Repositories

Public repositories in Amazon ECR are designed for sharing container images openly with the community. Images stored here are published on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery and can be pulled by anyone without requiring AWS credentials.

Although the images are public, you still control who can push new images or make changes via repository policies. This ensures that while the content is accessible to everyone, the ability to modify it remains restricted.

### 2.3. Pull-Through Cache Repositories

These repositories act as a caching layer for images hosted on external public registries (for example, Docker Hub). When you pull an image, ECR first checks its local cache and, if the image isn’t present, retrieves and stores it from the upstream registry.

## 3. Image Scanning

Amazon ECR’s image scanning is designed to help you maintain a secure container supply chain by automatically checking your container images for known vulnerabilities. Key aspects include:

- **Automated Vulnerability Detection:**  
    When an image is pushed to ECR, the built‐in scanning feature checks the image against known vulnerability databases (using CVE identifiers). This scan covers both the operating system packages and application dependencies.

- **Basic vs. Enhanced Scanning:**
    - _Basic Scanning_ provides an initial overview of vulnerabilities.
    - _Enhanced Scanning_ integrates deeper security analysis, often in combination with Amazon Inspector, which can provide more contextual risk assessments.

- **Integration with Security Workflows:**  
	Scan findings are reported in ECR and can be sent to other AWS services like AWS Security Hub. This integration lets you incorporate image vulnerability data into your CI/CD pipelines, triggering automated remediation or alerts if critical vulnerabilities are detected.

## 4. Lifecycle Policies

Lifecycle policies in Amazon ECR help you manage the growth of your image repositories over time by automating the cleanup of outdated images. Here’s how they work:

- **Rule-Based Image Management:**  
    You define a set of rules based on attributes such as:
    - **Tag patterns:** For example, keep only images tagged with "latest" or matching a specific version pattern.
    - **Creation dates:** Delete images older than a certain age.
    - **Image count:** Maintain only a fixed number of the most recent images.
- **Automated Cleanup:**  
    Once a rule is in place, Amazon ECR automatically evaluates images in the repository and deletes or archives those that meet the criteria. This process helps reduce storage costs and minimizes the risk of deploying outdated images that might have unpatched vulnerabilities.
- **Operational Benefits:**  
    Lifecycle policies ensure that your repository remains manageable, reduces clutter, and aligns with compliance or operational policies by enforcing a regular cleanup process.

## 5. Cross-Region and Cross-Account Replication

Amazon ECR supports advanced replication capabilities, which are critical for both performance optimization and organizational structure:

- **Cross-Region Replication:**
    - **Purpose:**  
        Automatically replicates images from a repository in one AWS Region to one or more repositories in other Regions.
    - **Benefits:**
        - **Reduced Latency:** Deploy applications closer to your end users by keeping container images in regions that are geographically nearer.
        - **Disaster Recovery:** In the event of a regional outage, having images replicated ensures that your applications can be redeployed in an alternative region quickly.
    - **Configuration:**  
        You set up replication rules in your ECR registry settings, specifying the source and target regions along with any filtering criteria.

- **Cross-Account Replication:**
    - **Purpose:**  
        Facilitates the sharing of container images between different AWS accounts. This is particularly useful in multi-account environments (such as those set up via AWS Organizations) where different business units or environments (e.g., development vs. production) require access to the same images.
    - **Benefits:**
        - **Security Isolation:** Allows you to maintain strict separation of duties while still sharing the necessary images.
        - **Centralized Image Management:** Enables a central team (such as a platform team) to build and update images that can then be used across several accounts.
    - **Configuration:**  
        You configure replication rules along with repository policies to grant permission for cross-account image pulls and pushes. These policies ensure that only authorized accounts can access or modify the images.

## 6. Conclusion

Amazon ECR provides a robust, scalable, and secure registry for managing container images and artifacts. With its tight integration with AWS’s container orchestration services (ECS, EKS, and Fargate), built-in security features (image scanning, encryption, and fine-grained IAM controls), and support for advanced image management features (lifecycle policies, replication, and pull-through cache), ECR is an essential component for organizations adopting containerized applications.

# Amazon Kendra

## 1. Introduction

Amazon Kendra is a fully managed, intelligent search service that leverages advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques to deliver highly accurate and contextually relevant search results. Unlike traditional keyword-based search systems, Kendra uses semantic understanding to interpret natural language queries and return precise answers. It allows organizations to build a unified search experience across multiple repositories—from on‑premises file systems to cloud data sources such as Amazon S3, SharePoint, Box, and databases—helping users quickly find the information they need. In addition, recent enhancements include integration with generative AI capabilities for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and enterprise search solutions.

## 2. Features and Capabilities

Amazon Kendra offers a broad range of features designed to simplify the process of building and deploying an enterprise search solution:

- **Natural Language and Semantic Search:**  
    Kendra understands conversational queries, meaning users can ask questions in natural language and get direct answers or relevant passages. Its deep learning models rank search results based on semantic and contextual relevance.  
    
- **Rich Data Source Connectivity:**  
    Kendra includes a suite of pre-built connectors for popular data repositories (e.g. Amazon S3, Microsoft SharePoint, Box, databases, and more) so that you can index documents, FAQs, and even multimedia files seamlessly.  
    
- **Customizable Relevance Tuning:**  
    You can fine‑tune search relevance using custom index field mappings, configurable attributes, and even override default ranking to boost certain documents or content types.
    
- **Access Control and Security:**  
    With built‑in support for token‑based access and integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Kendra ensures that search results respect your organization’s security and compliance policies. This allows users to see only the content for which they are authorized.

    Recent enhancements include support for Kendra GenAI indices, enabling integration with generative AI solutions (such as those powered by Amazon Bedrock) to deliver even richer, augmented search experiences.

    Whether you have tens of thousands or millions of documents, Kendra scales automatically while maintaining high query performance and low latency.
